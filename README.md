# GAUDI Project
GAUDI (Genetic Algorithm for Unified Docking Inference) provides a novel method in docking essays by combining several chemostructural criteria, along with energy optimization.

## Features
**True multi-objective optimization**

* Feel free to optimize H bonds, hydrophobic interactions, desolvation effects, distances between given sets of atoms, rotamers and more.

**Force-field-less approach**

* Metal complexes are more than welcome.

**Unprecedented customizability**

* Each objective can be switched off upon demand.

* The weights can be auto-optimized for each essay.
