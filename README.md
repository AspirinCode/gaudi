# Hyde project
Some description here

ROADMAP
=======
## Performance
* Render all possible molecules at the beginning, rather than every iteration
* Review insertMol() looping. It may be redundant
* Add multithreading support

## Known bugs
* Reported clashes and H bonds values < actual values!

## Coding
* Clean the code
	- Variable names, especially `target` and `anchor`
* OOP conversion
