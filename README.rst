GAUDI Project
=============
GAUDIasm: Genetic Algorithms for Universal Design Inference and Atomic Scale Modeling provides a novel method in design essays by combining several chemostructural criteria, along with energy-like optimization.

Features
--------

**True multi-objective optimization**

- Feel free to optimize H bonds, hydrophobic interactions, desolvation effects, distances between given sets of atoms, rotamers and more.

**Force-field-less approach**

- Metal complexes are more than welcome.

**Unprecedented customizability**

- Each objective can be switched off upon demand, and multi-instantiated.
